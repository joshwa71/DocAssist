# MPS backend¶

`mps` device enables high-performance training on GPU for MacOS devices with
Metal programming framework. It introduces a new device to map Machine
Learning computational graphs and primitives on highly efficient Metal
Performance Shaders Graph framework and tuned kernels provided by Metal
Performance Shaders framework respectively.

The new MPS backend extends the PyTorch ecosystem and provides existing
scripts capabilities to setup and run operations on GPU.

To get started, simply move your Tensor and Module to the `mps` device:

    
    
    # Check that MPS is available
    if not torch.backends.mps.is_available():
        if not torch.backends.mps.is_built():
            print("MPS not available because the current PyTorch install was not "
                  "built with MPS enabled.")
        else:
            print("MPS not available because the current MacOS version is not 12.3+ "
                  "and/or you do not have an MPS-enabled device on this machine.")
    
    else:
        mps_device = torch.device("mps")
    
        # Create a Tensor directly on the mps device
        x = torch.ones(5, device=mps_device)
        # Or
        x = torch.ones(5, device="mps")
    
        # Any operation happens on the GPU
        y = x * 2
    
        # Move your model to mps just like any other device
        model = YourFavoriteNet()
        model.to(mps_device)
    
        # Now every call runs on the GPU
        pred = model(x)
