# torch.index_select¶

torch.index_select( _input_ , _dim_ , _index_ , _*_ , _out =None_) -> Tensor¶

    

Returns a new tensor which indexes the `input` tensor along dimension `dim`
using the entries in `index` which is a LongTensor.

The returned tensor has the same number of dimensions as the original tensor
(`input`). The `dim`th dimension has the same size as the length of `index`;
other dimensions have the same size as in the original tensor.

Note

The returned tensor does **not** use the same storage as the original tensor.
If `out` has a different shape than expected, we silently change it to the
correct shape, reallocating the underlying storage if necessary.

Parameters

    

  * **input** ( _Tensor_) – the input tensor.

  * **dim** ( _int_) – the dimension in which we index

  * **index** ( _IntTensor_ _or_ _LongTensor_ ) – the 1-D tensor containing the indices to index

Keyword Arguments

    

**out** ( _Tensor_ _,_ _optional_ ) – the output tensor.

Example:

    
    
    >>> x = torch.randn(3, 4)
    >>> x
    tensor([[ 0.1427,  0.0231, -0.5414, -1.0009],
            [-0.4664,  0.2647, -0.1228, -1.1068],
            [-1.1734, -0.6571,  0.7230, -0.6004]])
    >>> indices = torch.tensor([0, 2])
    >>> torch.index_select(x, 0, indices)
    tensor([[ 0.1427,  0.0231, -0.5414, -1.0009],
            [-1.1734, -0.6571,  0.7230, -0.6004]])
    >>> torch.index_select(x, 1, indices)
    tensor([[ 0.1427, -0.5414],
            [-0.4664, -0.1228],
            [-1.1734,  0.7230]])
