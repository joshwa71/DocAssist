# torch.autograd.functional.hvp¶

torch.autograd.functional.hvp( _func_ , _inputs_ , _v =None_, _create_graph
=False_, _strict =False_)[source]¶

    

Function that computes the dot product between the Hessian of a given scalar
function and a vector `v` at the point given by the inputs.

Parameters

    

  * **func** ( _function_ ) – a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns a Tensor with a single element.

  * **inputs** ( _tuple_ _of_ _Tensors_ _or_ _Tensor_) – inputs to the function `func`.

  * **v** ( _tuple_ _of_ _Tensors_ _or_ _Tensor_) – The vector for which the Hessian vector product is computed. Must be the same size as the input of `func`. This argument is optional when `func`’s input contains a single element and (if it is not provided) will be set as a Tensor containing a single `1`.

  * **create_graph** ( _bool_ _,_ _optional_ ) – If `True`, both the output and result will be computed in a differentiable way. Note that when `strict` is `False`, the result can not require gradients or be disconnected from the inputs. Defaults to `False`.

  * **strict** ( _bool_ _,_ _optional_ ) – If `True`, an error will be raised when we detect that there exists an input such that all the outputs are independent of it. If `False`, we return a Tensor of zeros as the hvp for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical value. Defaults to `False`.

Returns

    

tuple with:

    

func_output (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): output of `func(inputs)`

hvp (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): result of the dot product with the same
shape as the inputs.

Return type

    

output (tuple)

Example

    
    
    >>> def pow_reducer(x):
    ...     return x.pow(3).sum()
    >>> inputs = torch.rand(2, 2)
    >>> v = torch.ones(2, 2)
    >>> hvp(pow_reducer, inputs, v)
    (tensor(0.1448),
     tensor([[2.0239, 1.6456],
             [2.4988, 1.4310]]))
    
    
    
    >>> hvp(pow_reducer, inputs, v, create_graph=True)
    (tensor(0.1448, grad_fn=<SumBackward0>),
     tensor([[2.0239, 1.6456],
             [2.4988, 1.4310]], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>))
    
    
    
    >>> def pow_adder_reducer(x, y):
    ...     return (2 * x.pow(2) + 3 * y.pow(2)).sum()
    >>> inputs = (torch.rand(2), torch.rand(2))
    >>> v = (torch.zeros(2), torch.ones(2))
    >>> hvp(pow_adder_reducer, inputs, v)
    (tensor(2.3030),
     (tensor([0., 0.]),
      tensor([6., 6.])))
    

Note

This function is significantly slower than vhp due to backward mode AD
constraints. If your functions is twice continuously differentiable, then hvp
= vhp.t(). So if you know that your function satisfies this condition, you
should use vhp instead that is much faster with the current implementation.
