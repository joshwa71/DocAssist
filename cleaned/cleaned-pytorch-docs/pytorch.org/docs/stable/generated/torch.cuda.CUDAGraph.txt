# CUDAGraph¶

_class _torch.cuda.CUDAGraph[source]¶

    

Wrapper around a CUDA graph.

Warning

This API is in beta and may change in future releases.

capture_begin( _pool =None_, _capture_error_mode ='global'_)[source]¶

    

Begins capturing CUDA work on the current stream.

Typically, you shouldn’t call `capture_begin` yourself. Use `graph` or
`make_graphed_callables()`, which call `capture_begin` internally.

Parameters

    

  * **pool** ( _optional_ ) – Token (returned by `graph_pool_handle()` or `other_Graph_instance.pool()`) that hints this graph may share memory with the indicated pool. See Graph memory management.

  * **capture_error_mode** ( _str_ _,_ _optional_ ) – specifies the cudaStreamCaptureMode for the graph capture stream. Can be “global”, “thread_local” or “relaxed”. During cuda graph capture, some actions, such as cudaMalloc, may be unsafe. “global” will error on actions in other threads, “thread_local” will only error for actions in the current thread, and “relaxed” will not error on these actions. Do NOT change this setting unless you’re familiar with cudaStreamCaptureMode

capture_end()[source]¶

    

Ends CUDA graph capture on the current stream. After `capture_end`, `replay`
may be called on this instance.

Typically, you shouldn’t call `capture_end` yourself. Use `graph` or
`make_graphed_callables()`, which call `capture_end` internally.

debug_dump( _debug_path_ )[source]¶

    

Parameters

    

**debug_path** ( _required_ ) – Path to dump the graph to.

Calls a debugging function to dump the graph if the debugging is enabled via
CUDAGraph.enable_debug_mode()

enable_debug_mode()[source]¶

    

Enables debugging mode for CUDAGraph.debug_dump.

pool()[source]¶

    

Returns an opaque token representing the id of this graph’s memory pool. This
id can optionally be passed to another graph’s `capture_begin`, which hints
the other graph may share the same memory pool.

replay()[source]¶

    

Replays the CUDA work captured by this graph.

reset()[source]¶

    

Deletes the graph currently held by this instance.
