# torch.nanmean¶

torch.nanmean( _input_ , _dim =None_, _keepdim =False_, _*_ , _dtype =None_,
_out =None_) -> Tensor¶

    

Computes the mean of all non-NaN elements along the specified dimensions.

This function is identical to `torch.mean()` when there are no NaN values in
the `input` tensor. In the presence of NaN, `torch.mean()` will propagate the
NaN to the output whereas `torch.nanmean()` will ignore the NaN values
(torch.nanmean(a) is equivalent to torch.mean(a[~a.isnan()])).

If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensor is of the same size as `input`
except in the dimension(s) `dim` where it is of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is
squeezed (see `torch.squeeze()`), resulting in the output tensor having 1 (or
`len(dim)`) fewer dimension(s).

Parameters

    

  * **input** ( _Tensor_) – the input tensor.

  * **dim** ( _int_ _or_ _tuple_ _of_ _ints_ _,_ _optional_ ) – the dimension or dimensions to reduce. If `None`, all dimensions are reduced.

  * **keepdim** ( _bool_) – whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.

Keyword Arguments

    

  * **dtype** (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. If specified, the input tensor is casted to `dtype` before the operation is performed. This is useful for preventing data type overflows. Default: None.

  * **out** ( _Tensor_ _,_ _optional_ ) – the output tensor.

See also

`torch.mean()` computes the mean value, propagating NaN.

Example:

    
    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([[torch.nan, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]])
    >>> x.mean()
    tensor(nan)
    >>> x.nanmean()
    tensor(1.8000)
    >>> x.mean(dim=0)
    tensor([   nan, 1.5000, 2.5000])
    >>> x.nanmean(dim=0)
    tensor([1.0000, 1.5000, 2.5000])
    
    # If all elements in the reduced dimensions are NaN then the result is NaN
    >>> torch.tensor([torch.nan]).nanmean()
    tensor(nan)
