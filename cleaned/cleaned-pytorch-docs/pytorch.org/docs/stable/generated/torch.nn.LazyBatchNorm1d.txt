# LazyBatchNorm1d¶

_class _torch.nn.LazyBatchNorm1d( _eps =1e-05_, _momentum =0.1_, _affine
=True_, _track_running_stats =True_, _device =None_, _dtype =None_)[source]¶

    

A `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d` module with lazy initialization of the `num_features`
argument of the `BatchNorm1d` that is inferred from the `input.size(1)`. The
attributes that will be lazily initialized are weight, bias, running_mean and
running_var.

Check the `torch.nn.modules.lazy.LazyModuleMixin` for further documentation on
lazy modules and their limitations.

Parameters

    

  * **eps** ( _float_) – a value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default: 1e-5

  * **momentum** ( _float_) – the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation. Can be set to `None` for cumulative moving average (i.e. simple average). Default: 0.1

  * **affine** ( _bool_) – a boolean value that when set to `True`, this module has learnable affine parameters. Default: `True`

  * **track_running_stats** ( _bool_) – a boolean value that when set to `True`, this module tracks the running mean and variance, and when set to `False`, this module does not track such statistics, and initializes statistics buffers `running_mean` and `running_var` as `None`. When these buffers are `None`, this module always uses batch statistics. in both training and eval modes. Default: `True`
