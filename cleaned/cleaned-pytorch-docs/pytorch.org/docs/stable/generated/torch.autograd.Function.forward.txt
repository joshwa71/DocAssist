# torch.autograd.Function.forward¶

_static _Function.forward( _ctx_ , _* args_, _** kwargs_)¶

    

This function is to be overridden by all subclasses. There are two ways to
define forward:

Usage 1 (Combined forward and ctx):

    
    
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx: Any, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        pass
    

  * It must accept a context ctx as the first argument, followed by any number of arguments (tensors or other types).

  * See Combined or separate forward() and setup_context() for more details

Usage 2 (Separate forward and ctx):

    
    
    @staticmethod
    def forward(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def setup_context(ctx: Any, inputs: Tuple[Any, ...], output: Any) -> None:
        pass
    

  * The forward no longer accepts a ctx argument.

  * Instead, you must also override the `torch.autograd.Function.setup_context()` staticmethod to handle setting up the `ctx` object. `output` is the output of the forward, `inputs` are a Tuple of inputs to the forward.

  * See Extending torch.autograd for more details

The context can be used to store arbitrary data that can be then retrieved
during the backward pass. Tensors should not be stored directly on ctx (though
this is not currently enforced for backward compatibility). Instead, tensors
should be saved either with `ctx.save_for_backward()` if they are intended to
be used in `backward` (equivalently, `vjp`) or `ctx.save_for_forward()` if
they are intended to be used for in `jvp`.
