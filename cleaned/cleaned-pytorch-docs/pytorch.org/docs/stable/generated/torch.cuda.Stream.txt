# Stream¶

_class _torch.cuda.Stream( _device =None_, _priority =0_, _**
kwargs_)[source]¶

    

Wrapper around a CUDA stream.

A CUDA stream is a linear sequence of execution that belongs to a specific
device, independent from other streams. See CUDA semantics for details.

Parameters

    

  * **device** ( _torch.device_ _or_ _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – a device on which to allocate the stream. If `device` is `None` (default) or a negative integer, this will use the current device.

  * **priority** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – priority of the stream, should be 0 or negative, where negative numbers indicate higher priority. By default, streams have priority 0.

query()[source]¶

    

Checks if all the work submitted has been completed.

Returns

    

A boolean indicating if all kernels in this stream are completed.

record_event( _event =None_)[source]¶

    

Records an event.

Parameters

    

**event** ( _torch.cuda.Event_ _,_ _optional_ ) – event to record. If not
given, a new one will be allocated.

Returns

    

Recorded event.

synchronize()[source]¶

    

Wait for all the kernels in this stream to complete.

Note

This is a wrapper around `cudaStreamSynchronize()`: see CUDA Stream
documentation for more info.

wait_event( _event_ )[source]¶

    

Makes all future work submitted to the stream wait for an event.

Parameters

    

**event** ( _torch.cuda.Event_) – an event to wait for.

Note

This is a wrapper around `cudaStreamWaitEvent()`: see CUDA Stream
documentation for more info.

This function returns without waiting for `event`: only future operations are
affected.

wait_stream( _stream_ )[source]¶

    

Synchronizes with another stream.

All future work submitted to this stream will wait until all kernels submitted
to a given stream at the time of call complete.

Parameters

    

**stream** ( _Stream_) – a stream to synchronize.

Note

This function returns without waiting for currently enqueued kernels in
`stream`: only future operations are affected.
