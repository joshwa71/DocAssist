# torch.pca_lowrank¶

torch.pca_lowrank( _A_ , _q =None_, _center =True_, _niter =2_)[source]¶

    

Performs linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a low-rank matrix,
batches of such matrices, or sparse matrix.

This function returns a namedtuple `(U, S, V)` which is the nearly optimal
approximation of a singular value decomposition of a centered matrix AAA such
that A=Udiag(S)VTA = U diag(S) V^TA=Udiag(S)VT.

Note

The relation of `(U, S, V)` to PCA is as follows:

  * AAA is a data matrix with `m` samples and `n` features

  * the VVV columns represent the principal directions

  * S∗∗2/(m−1)S ** 2 / (m - 1)S∗∗2/(m−1) contains the eigenvalues of ATA/(m−1)A^T A / (m - 1)ATA/(m−1) which is the covariance of `A` when `center=True` is provided.

  * `matmul(A, V[:, :k])` projects data to the first k principal components

Note

Different from the standard SVD, the size of returned matrices depend on the
specified rank and q values as follows:

>   * UUU is m x q matrix
>
>   * SSS is q-vector
>
>   * VVV is n x q matrix
>
>

Note

To obtain repeatable results, reset the seed for the pseudorandom number
generator

Parameters

    

  * **A** ( _Tensor_) – the input tensor of size (∗,m,n)(*, m, n)(∗,m,n)

  * **q** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – a slightly overestimated rank of AAA. By default, `q = min(6, m, n)`.

  * **center** ( _bool_ _,_ _optional_ ) – if True, center the input tensor, otherwise, assume that the input is centered.

  * **niter** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – the number of subspace iterations to conduct; niter must be a nonnegative integer, and defaults to 2.

Return type

    

_Tuple_[ _Tensor_, _Tensor_, _Tensor_]
