# torch.cuda.comm.scatter¶

torch.cuda.comm.scatter( _tensor_ , _devices =None_, _chunk_sizes =None_, _dim
=0_, _streams =None_, _*_ , _out =None_)[source]¶

    

Scatters tensor across multiple GPUs.

Parameters

    

  * **tensor** ( _Tensor_) – tensor to scatter. Can be on CPU or GPU.

  * **devices** ( _Iterable_ _[_ _torch.device_ _,_ _str_ _or_ _int_ _]_ _,_ _optional_ ) – an iterable of GPU devices, among which to scatter.

  * **chunk_sizes** ( _Iterable_ _[_ _int_ _]_ _,_ _optional_ ) – sizes of chunks to be placed on each device. It should match `devices` in length and sums to `tensor.size(dim)`. If not specified, `tensor` will be divided into equal chunks.

  * **dim** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – A dimension along which to chunk `tensor`. Default: `0`.

  * **streams** ( _Iterable_ _[_ _torch.cuda.Stream_ _]_ _,_ _optional_ ) – an iterable of Streams, among which to execute the scatter. If not specified, the default stream will be utilized.

  * **out** ( _Sequence_ _[_ _Tensor_ _]_ _,_ _optional_ _,_ _keyword-only_ ) – the GPU tensors to store output results. Sizes of these tensors must match that of `tensor`, except for `dim`, where the total size must sum to `tensor.size(dim)`.

Note

Exactly one of `devices` and `out` must be specified. When `out` is specified,
`chunk_sizes` must not be specified and will be inferred from sizes of `out`.

Returns

    

  * If `devices` is specified,
    

a tuple containing chunks of `tensor`, placed on `devices`.

  * If `out` is specified,
    

a tuple containing `out` tensors, each containing a chunk of `tensor`.
