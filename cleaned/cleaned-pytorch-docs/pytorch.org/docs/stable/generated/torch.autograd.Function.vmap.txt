# torch.autograd.Function.vmap¶

_static _Function.vmap( _info_ , _in_dims_ , _* args_)[source]¶

    

Defines a rule for the behavior of this autograd.Function underneath
`torch.vmap()`. For a `torch.autograd.Function()` to support `torch.vmap()`,
you must either override this staticmethod, or set `generate_vmap_rule` to
`True` (you may not do both).

If you choose to override this staticmethod: it must accept

  * an `info` object as the first argument. `info.batch_size` specifies the size of the dimension being vmapped over, while `info.randomness` is the randomness option passed to `torch.vmap()`.

  * an `in_dims` tuple as the second argument. For each arg in `args`, `in_dims` has a corresponding `Optional[int]`. It is `None` if the arg is not a Tensor or if the arg is not being vmapped over, otherwise, it is an integer specifying what dimension of the Tensor is being vmapped over.

  * `*args`, which is the same as the args to `forward()`.

The return of the vmap staticmethod is a tuple of `(output, out_dims)`.
Similar to `in_dims`, `out_dims` should be of the same structure as `output`
and contain one `out_dim` per output that specifies if the output has the
vmapped dimension and what index it is in.

Please see Extending torch.func with autograd.Function for more details.
