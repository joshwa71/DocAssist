# torch.diagonal¶

torch.diagonal( _input_ , _offset =0_, _dim1 =0_, _dim2 =1_) -> Tensor¶

    

Returns a partial view of `input` with the its diagonal elements with respect
to `dim1` and `dim2` appended as a dimension at the end of the shape.

The argument `offset` controls which diagonal to consider:

  * If `offset` = 0, it is the main diagonal.

  * If `offset` > 0, it is above the main diagonal.

  * If `offset` < 0, it is below the main diagonal.

Applying `torch.diag_embed()` to the output of this function with the same
arguments yields a diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries of the input.
However, `torch.diag_embed()` has different default dimensions, so those need
to be explicitly specified.

Parameters

    

  * **input** ( _Tensor_) – the input tensor. Must be at least 2-dimensional.

  * **offset** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – which diagonal to consider. Default: 0 (main diagonal).

  * **dim1** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – first dimension with respect to which to take diagonal. Default: 0.

  * **dim2** ( _int_ _,_ _optional_ ) – second dimension with respect to which to take diagonal. Default: 1.

Note

To take a batch diagonal, pass in dim1=-2, dim2=-1.

Examples:

    
    
    >>> a = torch.randn(3, 3)
    >>> a
    tensor([[-1.0854,  1.1431, -0.1752],
            [ 0.8536, -0.0905,  0.0360],
            [ 0.6927, -0.3735, -0.4945]])
    
    
    >>> torch.diagonal(a, 0)
    tensor([-1.0854, -0.0905, -0.4945])
    
    
    >>> torch.diagonal(a, 1)
    tensor([ 1.1431,  0.0360])
    
    
    >>> x = torch.randn(2, 5, 4, 2)
    >>> torch.diagonal(x, offset=-1, dim1=1, dim2=2)
    tensor([[[-1.2631,  0.3755, -1.5977, -1.8172],
             [-1.1065,  1.0401, -0.2235, -0.7938]],
    
            [[-1.7325, -0.3081,  0.6166,  0.2335],
             [ 1.0500,  0.7336, -0.3836, -1.1015]]])
